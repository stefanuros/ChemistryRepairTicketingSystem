As emailing is currently down (I believe due to changing from gmail -> queensu.ca)
showTickets.js lines 79-90 have been commented out.
This means no emailing will occur during any submit changes (status changes) 

This also means the status message saying "Saving changes please wait" Will pop up for 0.1 seconds while changes are saved, and disapear
this message will be displayed for longer when the emails are being sent.
